## Условие: Task 4. Refactor task 3 using do while statement
* 4.1 Run the program
* 4.2 Use if statement to modify the program so that it works correctly if the user inputs zero as the k value. Run the program, enter 0 when prompted for k.
* 4.3  Use if statement to modify the program so that it outputs a warning if the user input is not an integer. After the warning the program should prompt for the integer again.

## Actually I did both of tasks in one code, that's why I apploaded the same codes in different branches... ⭐
I hope that it isn't a problem ☺️
